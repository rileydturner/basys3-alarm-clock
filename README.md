# basys3-alarm-clock
SDSU Lab using Basys3 board to imitate alarm clock utilizing seven segment display.

The purpose of this lab was to create a clock/alarm clock system on the Basys3 Board.
This is possible by utilizing the seven segment display to display the time, buttons to set a time,
and the LED to light up signaling the alarm went off. The clock will essentially be a 12 minute
clock that will cycle from 12 to 1. This will simulate a 12 hour clock system.
